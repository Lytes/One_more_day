# One_more_day
I was in a bad place mentally, so I'd download new songs every morning to have something to look forward to. 
I hope this script helps you.
Python wrapper script that downloads random new songs per day so you can find your own genre(s) or maybe just something to look forward to everyday.



# Steps
```
pip3 install youtube-dl
git clone https://github.com/Lytes/One_more_day.git
cd One_more_day
python3 main.py
```
